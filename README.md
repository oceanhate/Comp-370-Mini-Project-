## Project Overview

This project implements a **fault-tolerant primary-backup server system** with:

- **1 Monitor**: Detects server failures via heartbeat mechanism
- **3 Servers**: 1 Primary + 2 Backups with automatic failover
- **Client Application**: Automatically discovers and connects to primary server
- **Heartbeat Protocol**: Continuous health monitoring (2-second intervals)
- **Automatic Promotion**: Backup servers promoted to primary on failure detection
- **State Replication**: Message counter synchronized to all backups in real-time

### State Replication Details

The system maintains a **message counter** that tracks the total number of client messages processed:

- **Primary Server**: Increments counter for each client message received
- **Real-time Sync**: After each message, state is replicated to all backup servers
- **Seamless Failover**: When backup is promoted, it continues with the same count
- **No Data Loss**: Clients see consistent message counts across failovers

**Example:**

```
Primary receives 5 messages → Counter = 5 → Synced to backups
Primary fails → Backup promoted → New primary continues at Counter = 5
```

**Platform Compatibility:**

- **Core System**: Fully cross-platform (Java-based)
- **Bash Scripts**: The `run.sh` script automatically detects your OS and adapts:
  - **macOS**: Uses `osascript` to open new Terminal windows ✅ Confirmed working
  - **Linux**: Tries `gnome-terminal`, `xterm`, or `konsole` in order of preference
  - **Windows**: Supports Git Bash/Cygwin with `cmd.exe`
- **Kill/Stop/Status Scripts**: Work on Linux/macOS (use `lsof` command)
  - Windows users: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **Manual Operation**: Works on all platforms - just run each component in separate terminals:
  ```bash
  java -cp src Monitor
  java -cp src primary 8090
  java -cp src backup 8089
  java -cp src backup2 8088
  java -cp src Client
  ```

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- **macOS/Linux**: Bash shell (default on both)
- **Windows**: Git Bash or WSL recommended for script execution
- `lsof` utility (standard on macOS/Linux) for status and kill scripts

### Step 1: Make Scripts Executable

```bash
cd SocketServer/scripts
chmod +x *.sh
```

### Step 2: Start the System

```bash
./run.sh
```

This will:

1. Compile all Java files
2. Start Monitor in a new Terminal window
3. Start 3 Server instances in separate Terminal windows
4. Start Client in a new Terminal window

## Port Configuration

| Component    | Port | Purpose                          |
| ------------ | ---- | -------------------------------- |
| **Monitor**  | 9000 | Heartbeat reception from servers |
| **Monitor**  | 9001 | Client API for primary discovery |
| **Server 1** | 8090 | Primary server (initially)       |
| **Server 2** | 8089 | Backup server 1                  |
| **Server 3** | 8088 | Backup server 2                  |

**Promotion Priority**: Servers are promoted in descending port order (8090 → 8089 → 8088)

---

## Component Details

### Monitor (`Monitor.java`)

- **Heartbeat Listener**: Receives heartbeats on port 9000
- **Death Checker**: Runs every 2 seconds to detect server failures
- **Timeout**: 5 seconds without heartbeat = server presumed dead
- **Promotion Logic**: Promotes highest-port backup to primary on failure
- **No Auto-Demotion**: When failed primary restarts, it rejoins as backup (current primary stays primary)
- **Client API**: Port 9001 serves primary server information to clients

**Key Functions:**

- `handleHeartbeat()`: Processes incoming heartbeats with port# and timestamp
- `runDeathChecker()`: Monitors server liveness and triggers promotion only when primary fails
- `runClientApiListener()`: Responds to client requests for current primary

### ServerProcess (`ServerProcess.java`)

Abstract base class for all server instances.

**Features:**

- Sends heartbeats every 2 seconds (port# | timestamp format)
- Accepts client connections and handles requests
- Processes PROMOTE command from monitor
- Multi-threaded: separate threads for server listen and heartbeat sending
- **State Management**: Maintains message counter (`messageCount`)
- **State Replication**: Primary replicates state to backups after each message

**Key Methods:**

- `process()`: Starts server and heartbeat threads
- `sendHeartbeat()`: Sends heartbeat to monitor
- `handleClient()`: Processes client requests and replicates state
- `replicateStateToBackups()`: Sends state updates to all backup servers
- `onPromotedToPrimary()`: Hook for promotion logic

**State Protocol:**

- Primary increments `messageCount` on each client message
- Primary sends `STATE_UPDATE:<count>` to all backups
- Backups update their local `messageCount` to stay synchronized
- On promotion, backup already has current state

### Server Classes

- **`primary.java`**: Initially starts as primary server (port 8090)
- **`backup.java`**: Backup server 1 (port 8089)
- **`backup2.java`**: Backup server 2 (port 8088)

All extend `ServerProcess` and can be promoted to primary.

### Client (`Client.java`)

**Features:**

- **Strict Primary Connection**: Only connects to monitor's designated primary server
- Auto-discovers primary server via Monitor API (port 9001)
- Waits for monitor to promote new primary on failure (no fallback connections)
- Interactive message sending interface

**Behavior:**

- Queries Monitor for current primary on startup and after disconnections
- **Only connects to the server the monitor designates as primary**
- Does NOT connect to backup servers
- If primary is down, waits for monitor to detect failure and promote backup
- Retries connection every 5 seconds until new primary is available
- Ensures all messages go to the actual primary server

---

## Testing Scripts

All scripts are located in `SocketServer/scripts/`. See `SocketServer/scripts/README.md` for detailed documentation.

### Core Scripts (Required by Project)

#### 1. `run.sh` - Start Complete System

```bash
./run.sh
```

Starts Monitor, 3 servers, and client in separate Terminal windows.

**OS-Specific Behavior:**

- **macOS**: Opens new Terminal.app windows using AppleScript
- **Linux**: Tries gnome-terminal → xterm → konsole in order
- **Windows (Git Bash/Cygwin)**: Uses cmd.exe to launch bash terminals
- **Auto-detected**: Script automatically detects your OS and uses appropriate commands

#### 2. `kill-primary.sh` - Simulate Primary Crash

```bash
./kill-primary.sh
```

Kills the primary server process (port 8090) with timestamps.

**Important Notes:**

- All kill scripts use `-sTCP:LISTEN` flag to only kill server processes, not client connections. This ensures clients remain running and can reconnect after failover.
- **By design**, `kill-primary.sh` always kills port 8090, and `kill-backup.sh` kills port 8089 by default. However, the **actual primary** may be running on a different port after failover (like if 8090 was killed and 8089 became primary). The script names refer to the static port numbers, not the dynamic primary role.

#### 3. `delay-heartbeat.sh` - Simulate Network Delay

```bash
./delay-heartbeat.sh [seconds]
```

Creates flag file to trigger artificial delay in heartbeat processing.

### Additional Testing Scripts

#### 4. `kill-backup.sh` - Kill Backup Server

```bash
./kill-backup.sh [port]        # Default: 8089
./kill-backup.sh 8088           # Kill specific backup
```

**Note:** Kills the server on the specified port (8089 by default). The actual role (primary/backup) depends on current system state.

#### 5. `kill-primary-and-backup.sh` - Simultaneous Failures

```bash
./kill-primary-and-backup.sh [backup_port]
```

Kills primary (port 8090) and one backup simultaneously.

**Note:** Targets static ports 8090 and specified backup port, regardless of which server is currently acting as primary.

#### 6. `restart-server.sh` - Restart Crashed Server

**Auto-detect mode (Recommended)** - Automatically restarts any down servers:

```bash
./restart-server.sh             # Auto-detect and restart down servers
./restart-server.sh all         # Same as above
```

**Manual mode** - Restart specific server:

```bash
./restart-server.sh [port]
./restart-server.sh 8090        # Restart primary
./restart-server.sh 8089        # Restart backup on 8089
./restart-server.sh 8088        # Restart backup on 8088
```

**Features:**

- ✓ Auto-detects which servers are down (no arguments needed)
- ✓ Opens each restarted server in a new Terminal window
- ✓ Safe - won't restart servers that are already running
- ✓ Smart - only restarts what's needed
- ✓ **All restarted servers rejoin as backups** (even port 8090)
- ✓ Monitor will only promote to primary if current primary fails

**Important Behavior:**
When a failed server is restarted, it **always rejoins as a backup server**, regardless of what port it's on. The monitor maintains the current primary and will only trigger a new promotion if that primary fails. This prevents unnecessary disruption to the system.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation

**Steps:**

1. Run `./run.sh`
2. Verify heartbeats in Monitor window
3. Verify primary server selected (port 8090)
4. Send client requests
5. Verify responses and state replication

**Expected:**

- ✓ Primary server handles all client requests
- ✓ Backups receive state replication
- ✓ Heartbeats sent every 2 seconds

### Scenario 2: Primary Crash

**Steps:**

1. Run `./run.sh`
2. Run `./kill-primary.sh`
3. Record timestamps: kill time, detection time, failover time

**Expected:**

- ✓ Monitor detects failure within 5 seconds
- ✓ Backup promoted to primary (port 8089 or 8088)
- ✓ Clients automatically reconnect
- ✓ No request loss after reconnection

### Scenario 3: Backup Crash

**Steps:**

1. Run `./run.sh`
2. Run `./kill-backup.sh 8089`
3. Verify primary continues
4. Run `./restart-server.sh 8089`
5. Verify backup synchronizes state

**Expected:**

- ✓ Primary continues without disruption
- ✓ Restarted backup rejoins cluster
- ✓ State synchronized from primary

### Scenario 4: Simultaneous Failures

**Steps:**

1. Run `./run.sh`
2. Run `./kill-primary-and-backup.sh`
3. Run `./status.sh` to check survivors

**Expected:**

- ✓ Remaining server promoted to primary
- ✓ System continues if ≥1 server alive
- ✓ Graceful degradation documented

### Scenario 6: Recovery

**Steps:**

1. Run `./stop-all.sh`
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Run `./run.sh`
4. Observe server rejoin and state sync

**Expected:**

- ✓ Servers reconnect to monitor
- ✓ State synchronized correctly
- ✓ Correct roles assigned
- ✓ Normal operation resumes
